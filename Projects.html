                        For our final project in my Electrical Engineering 286 "EE DESIGN: <br />
                        THE PROCESS class, we designed and built a handheld, 3D printed <br />
                        dvice to launch marbles and also utilized two motors, 6 LEDs, an <br />
                        IR receiver, and a light sensor. The first thing we did after <br />
                        using a decision matrix to decide on this project, was make a <br />
                        model of what we wanted using things like paper or cardboard. <br />

                        Utilizing about 11 resistors, my team of 4 was able to measure up to <br />
                        10V from an external source. We started by making a Gantt Chart to <br />
                        keep our team on track.<br />

                        After that, we utilized the design process and decision matricies <br />
                        to determine what type of converter we would make. We decided on <br />
                        making a flash ADC and our schematic is shown below.<br />

                        Location Reminders is an application that I developed for Android as a <br />
                        summer project. This project was not for a class, was not suggested by <br />
                        anyone, and was only worked on by me in a little over one summer for <br />
                        a couple hours per day. <br />
                        This application allows the user to set a reminder for themselves to be<br />
                        activated when they reach a location. Ex, "The next time that I go to  <br />
                        Subway, remind me that I have a gift card for there." <br />
                        It utilizes a SQLite database to save the information and checks less <br />
                        frequently if the user is farther away to save battery and processing <br />
                        power. It can be found at GitHub.com/zac216.

                        assembly, and C (in that order). I have created bubble sorts and <br />

                        when this program would be useful would be if you wanted to take a <br />
