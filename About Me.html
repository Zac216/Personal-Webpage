                            I want to work for an electrical engineering/computer science based company. Specifically, how the two fields interact.
                            Ideally I would like to create a new and more efficient computer arcitecture to allow for faster computing times, and
                            more computing flexability. Food for thought: computers would run so much faster if they utilized
                            light instead of electricity.

                            opportunities around every corner. San Diego is definitely my first pick though.

                        Growing Up:
                        <div class="bulletItem">
                            I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona in a family with two loving parents and one younger brother. Specifically
                            I was raised on the edge of North Phoenix, almost in the city of Anthem. For my first year of high school I went to
                            Barry Goldwater High School for the International Baccalaureate program they had there. After my first year I switched
                            to Boulder Creek High School in Anthem because it was closer and more engineering focused rather than fine arts. Junior
                            year I got a job at Chili's as a host and then moved to dish for a pay raise. I had that job for over two years and only
                            left when I left to go to Northern Arizona University and I have been here ever since.
                        </div>
                        Past Achievements:
                        <div class="bulletItem">
                            - Completed an internship at ASU where we did research on thermoelectric generators and the power output
                            they each produced
                            - Graduated high school in the top 10% of my class of about 600 students
                            - Was the vice president of FBLA at my high school for one year and attended the state competition in Tucson
                            as well as the leadership trainings
                            - Attended the West-Mec Start coding program in 11th grade which taught me how to make websites including HTML, CSS,
                            Javascript, PHP, and MySQL
                            - Created an Android application titled "Location Reminders" which provided the user with reminders based on a location
                            they provided. It utilizes GPS and SQLite to store and check the location (unpublished but is on Github)
